order_number = 72

#comment Integers are whole numbers, Floats are decimals. Utilizing formulas can allow for math calculations. Example below.

type = "tshirt"
color = "blue"
size = "large"
order_size = 72

print (f"Three orders are a total of {order_size * 3} t-shirts.") 

bakery_name = "YumCakes"
product_name = "Cupcake"
product_type = "single"
product_type2 = "dozen"
product_weight_oz = 11.5
weight_type = "ounces"
weight_type2 = "lbs"
product_height_inch = 6.4
product_width_inch = 6.2
measure_type_inches = "inches"
measure_type_feet = "feet"

print (f"For Commercial Orders - {bakery_name} {product_name} {product_type2} weighs {product_weight_oz * 12 / 16} {weight_type2}. Each {product_name} is individually boxed at {product_height_inch} {measure_type_inches} by {product_width_inch} {measure_type_inches}.")
